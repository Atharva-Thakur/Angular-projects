# What is Typescript?
developed by microsoft
built on top of JS
JS kinda does anything like a spoiled kid
TS is more like a disciplined kid

Javascript with type checking
we write code in TS then pass it to a compiler

## Drawbacks
compilation/Transpilation -> converting to JS
disciplined in writing code

## Installation
`npm i -g typescript`
check installation with
`tsc -v`
